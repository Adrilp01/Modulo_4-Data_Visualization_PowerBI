In this project, I worked with Power BI to analyze Airbnb data. The main objective was to focus on listings located in Madrid and to explore a specific question based on the dataset. In my case, I decided to investigate how much impact the seasons have on rental behaviorâ€”examining whether prices, locations, and reviews vary significantly across different times of the year. To support this analysis, I created custom measures and KPIs that allowed me to explore the data more effectively.
